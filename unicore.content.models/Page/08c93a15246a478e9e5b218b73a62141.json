You can start off by using a search engine or Wikipedia, and typing in keywords that describe what you are look for.\r\n- If you are looking for information for school or university you should always check who wrote the information (also known as \u201cthe source\u201d or \u201creference\u201d).\r\n- Good sources/references for school/university projects include: universities, academic journals, websites of large organizations, official reports etc. \r\n- Keep a list of the websites you use to get your information.\r\n- You will probably need to include these in a list called a bibliography with your project. \r\n- As a best practice you should put the name and details of the original source in the bibliography for a school/university project. \r\n- Check how old the information is - newer information could be available. Remember that things like statistics change often.\r\n- Remember not everything that you read on the internet is true - be careful about what source you trust.\r\n\r\nNext Internet tip:",
