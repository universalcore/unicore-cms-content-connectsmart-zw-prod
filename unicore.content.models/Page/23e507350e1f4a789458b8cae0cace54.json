What should I do?**\r\n\r\n- Did you apply for a job or contact anyone for a job? If you did not this could be a scam - be careful. \r\n- Do some research about the company or business - do an internet search or ask your friends.\r\n- You should be careful when going to meet some for the first time if you met them on the internet.\r\n- Always pick a public place to meet (like a shopping mall).\r\n- Always tell a friend or family member where you are going and who you are meeting.\r\n- It is even better if you ask a friend or family member to come with you.\r\n\r\nNext Internet tip: ",
