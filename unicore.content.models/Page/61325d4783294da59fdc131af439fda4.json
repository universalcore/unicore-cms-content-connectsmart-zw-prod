I\u2019m not sure if this is a good idea\u2026?**\r\n\r\n- Remember that once you send a photo or video - of any kind - to someone you have no control over what happens to it. A photo or video can spread very quickly on the internet.\r\n- You may trust the person but sadly, sometimes if a relationship ends, or you have a fight or the phone gets into the wrong hands, those photos or videos can be used to embarrass you or hurt you.\r\n- It is almost impossible to remove a photo/video from the internet once it has spread.\r\n- Don\u2019t do something you\u2019ll regret.\r\n\r\nNext Internet tip: ",
