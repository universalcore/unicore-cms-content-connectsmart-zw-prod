Do you have friends in common? Are you from the same town?\r\n- You do not have to accept the request if you don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing private information with the person. Don\u2019t feel pressured to do so.\r\n- Check your privacy settings so that this person does not see your private information if you don\u2019t want them to.\r\n- Remember also that sometimes people pretend to be someone they are not on the internet. \r\n\r\nNext Internet tip: \r\n",
